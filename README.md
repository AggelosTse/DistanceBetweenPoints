# Distance Between Points

## Overview

2 python and 1 haskell script that calculates the distance between file's points and (0,0,0). Prints them in ascending order using quicksort.

## Scripts

1.sortpoints.py: Regular python.

2.sortpointsnumpy.py: Python but with numpy arrays instead of regular arrays, much faster.

3.sortpoints.hs: Haskell script.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AggelosTse/DistanceBetweenPoints.git

2. Use these commands:

    ```bash
   python3 sortpoints.py
   python3 sortpointsnumpy.py
   ghci sortpoints.hs    (first download GHC haskell compiler)
